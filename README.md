On the night of the Moon Festival,
When the sky is dark and still,
The round and glowing moon rises,
A sight that always thrills.

Families gather together,
To feast on mooncakes sweet,
And light up colorful lanterns,
That float along the street.

The air is filled with laughter,
And the fragrance of osmanthus,
As everyone shares stories,
And reminisces about us.

The moon is the star of the night,
A symbol of love and grace,
Its light shines down upon us,
And illuminates our face.

As we celebrate this special day,
Let us remember the beauty of life,
And the blessings that surround us,
Through joy and through strife.

So let us raise a toast,
To the moon and all its might,
And cherish each precious moment,
On this beautiful Moon Festival night.
