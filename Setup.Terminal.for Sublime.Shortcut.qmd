## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:


## Create a directory at ~/bin
```
mkdir ~/bin
```

## Copy sublime executable to your ~/bin directory:
```
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl
ZSH ## Turns out I have ZSH on my MacBook, but not bashrc etc (even though I don't know what it is)
```

## If using zsh add line to ~/.zshrc file:
```
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Set sublime as your default editor:
```
echo "export EDITOR='subl -w'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Restart terminal and type:
```
subl .
```

## Check unix commands:
```
ls
```
